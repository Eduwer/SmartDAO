# SmartDAO

Mainly, SmartDao is an idea to create an API for Java that can build a layer of 
intelligent and versatile data based on the SQL language focused on four DBMS: 
Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server and PostgreSQL. In other words, will serve as an 
abstraction layer for JDBC adding more features that allow versatility in the code, 
leaving aside the frameworks like Hibernate that focus on the automatic creation 
of source code. This project is in the planning stage.
